# TODO

This document lists the tasks that need to be completed for the `pymars` project.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality and sklearn Compatibility

*   [x] Implement categorical feature support.
*   [x] Implement missing value support.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

*   [ ] Implement interaction terms.
*   [ ] Implement generalized linear models (GLMs).
*   [ ] Implement cross-validation.
*   [ ] Implement plotting.

These items form the bulk of the work for Phase&nbsp;2 and will bring `pymars` closer to feature parity with other implementations.

## Phase 3: Performance and Optimization

*   [ ] Profile the code.
*   [ ] Optimize the code for speed.
*   [ ] Optimize the code for memory usage.
